Some more technical products benefit from displaying a specifications table.

The quick approach is to create a table within the product content field. This is fine, but can be limiting, particularly if you have many products requiring a specifications table, meaning it can be cumbersome to make any design changes.

For consistency and flexiblity, the table should be stored in the database.
